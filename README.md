# ardenpy
A simple toolkit for working with Arden Syntax MLMs under Python

## Description
This toolkit (ardenpy) was created in an attempt to help users work with Medical Logic Modules (MLMs) written using Arden Syntax in a Python environment. The end goal is to create a parser that generates suitable Python 3 code from Arden Syntax MLMs, with certain parameters and constraints, that can be run on a business rules engine written in Python.

This toolkit was written targeting Arden Syntax version 2.9. Please note that this toolkit is currently nowhere near ready for use, and as such, if you are looking for similar functionality, you should look elsewhere.
